# Naming Conventions

Single source of truth for artifact naming and file organization.

## Core Principle

One repo = one product. No product prefix needed.

## File Naming Pattern

```sh
[ARTIFACT-CODE][YYMMDD]-[slug](-[increment]).md
```

### Components

| Component | Required | Format | Example |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Artifact code | Yes | 2-4 uppercase letters | `COMP` |
| Date | Yes | YYMMDD | `250609` |
| Slug | Yes | 2-4 words, kebab-case, max 30 chars | `freshbooks-pricing` |
| Increment | No | `-2`, `-3`, etc. (only if collision) | `-2` |

### Examples

```sh
COMP250609-market-leaders.md
JTBD250609-onboarding-flow.md
PERS250609-smb-owner.md
RSYN250609-user-interviews.md
COMP250609-freshbooks-pricing-2.md   # second competitive analysis same day
```

## Artifact Codes

| Artifact                     | Code   | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Competitive Analysis         | `COMP` | Market and competitor research                  |
| Feature List                 | `FEAT` | Feature specifications from scope               |
| Information Architecture     | `IA`   | Site maps and content structure                 |
| JTBD                         | `JTBD` | Jobs to be done statements                      |
| Product Requirement Document | `PRD`  | Product requirements and specifications         |
| Research Synthesis           | `RSYN` | Synthesized research findings                   |
| Sample Data                  | `DATA` | Mock or test data sets                          |
| Scope Definition             | `SCOP` | Feature scope and requirements                  |
| Task List                    | `TASK` | Feature task breakdowns and acceptance criteria |
| Testing Plan                 | `TEST` | Test strategies and coverage plans              |
| User Flow                    | `FLOW` | Task flows and interaction sequences            |
| User Interview               | `INTV` | Interview notes and transcripts                 |
| User Journey Map             | `JMAP` | End-to-end user experience maps                 |
| User Persona                 | `PERS` | User persona definitions                        |

## Slug Rules

1. **Concise** - 2-4 words that describe the content
2. **Kebab-case** - Lowercase, hyphens between words
3. **No dates** - Date is already in the filename
4. **Descriptive** - Should answer "what is this about?"

### Good Slugs

- `freshbooks-pricing`
- `onboarding-pain-points`
- `smb-owner-profile`
- `beta-user-feedback`

### Bad Slugs

- `analysis` (too vague)
- `competitive-analysis-december` (redundant with code and date)
- `this-is-a-very-long-slug-that-goes-on-forever` (too long)

## Same-Day Collisions

When creating multiple artifacts of the same type on the same day:

- First: `COMP250609-freshbooks-pricing.md`
- Second: `COMP250609-xero-features-2.md`
- Third: `COMP250609-wave-onboarding-3.md`

Increment appends at the end, before the extension.
